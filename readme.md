A generic template for creating interactive maps from a simple csv.

### Demo

You can access a demo, which uses a random dataset, [here](http://robinl.github.io/interactive_maps_template/):  


### Instructions

To modify for your purposes, you need to change the following file:

https://github.com/RobinL/interactive_maps_template/blob/master/data/data_template.csv

and change the config file so that it aligns with your column names

https://github.com/RobinL/interactive_maps_template/blob/master/js/custom_code/column_description.js (edited)

and it should  work.

Current code is set up to run from a shared drive (i.e. without ajax), so you have to convert the csv into json, like this: https://github.com/RobinL/interactive_maps_template/blob/master/data/csv_data.js 

But thereâ€™s some code in the main scripts you can uncomment out and make it work from the csv instead if you have a proper web server:
